                <p>This prototype was designed, coded and implemented by <b>David Enrique Sanchez Oliva</b> at Newcastle University, UK, during 2016-2017 as part of a research in <i>Visualisation of Access Control Policies</i>. The research was supervised by <b>Dr. Charles Morisset</b>.</p>

                <p>This prototype was created using Javascript, HTML and CSS. It was tested in Firefox 50-51 under macOS 10.11.6 and 10.12.4 (OS X El Capitan-Sierra) on a MacBook and iMac. It was coded using NetBeans 8.2. Additional testing is required in other browsers and platforms<a href="#footnote-1">[1]</a>.</p>

                <p>D3 Library, <a href="https://d3js.org">https://d3js.org</a>,  was used to create the Visualisation of Access Control Policies. In particular <i>Circle Pack Zoom</i> was adapted into the conventions of <i>Logic Circle Packing</i>, using as a starting point code from Mike Bostock.
